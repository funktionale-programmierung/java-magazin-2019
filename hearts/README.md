# Hearts

Simplest rules as extracted from
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game))

## Objective

The overall objective is to be the player with the fewest points by the end of the game.

## Dealing

Full deck of 52 cards. Four players. Thirteen cards are dealt to each
player.

## Gameplay

The first trick is led by the player to the left of the dealer.
Each other player, in clockwise order, then plays a card from their
hand.
Players must follow suit.
If they are not able to do so, they can play any card.
The trick is won by the player who played the highest-value card of
the suit that was led.
That player becomes the lead player for the next trick.
Play continues until all players have exhausted their hands.

### Variant that requires gameplay history

Hearts cannot be led until they have been "broken" (discarded on the lead of another suit), unless the player who must lead has nothing but Hearts remaining in hand.

## Scoring

Each Heart taken in a trick scores one penalty point against the
player winning the trick.
Taking Qâ™  costs 13 penalty points.
There are thus 26 penalty points in each deal.
The winning player is the one with the fewest penalty points.

### Variant: Shooting the moon

A player can also win by taking all penalty points in a deal.
